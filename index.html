        Track Plants Water respects your concerns about privacy and values our
        relationship with you. This Policy describes the types of information we
        collect through the App, how that information may be used and/or with
        whom it may be shared; and how you can reach us to update your contact
        information, access and control the use of the information we collect in
        connection with our marketing communications and activities or get
        answers to questions you may have about our privacy practices. Please
        read this Policy carefully, because by using the Track Plants Water, you
        are acknowledging that you understand and agree to the terms of this
        Policy.<br /><br />
        1. What is Personal Information.<br />
        As used herein, the term "Personal Information" means information that
        specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, e-mail address),
        or information about that individual that is directly linked to
        personally identifiable information. Personal Information does not
        include "aggregate information," which is data we collect about the use
        of the Track Plants Water or about a group or category of services or
        users from which individual identities or other personal information has
        been removed. Personal Information also does not include Usage
        Information (as defined below) or Device Identifier (as defined below)
        that is not connected to Personal Information. This Policy in no way
        restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate or Usage
        Information that is not connected to Personal Information.<br /><br />
